# 🖼️ Object Detection with YOLOv10 — Custom Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build an Object Detection pipeline using **YOLOv10** from the Ultralytics library.  
The notebook includes dataset loading, visualization, model inference, and comparison between original and detected images.

## 📌 Features
- Load and visualize images from custom folders using `glob`.
- Display random samples from each dataset (fruits, flowers, drones, guns, people, streets, digits).
- Run **Object Detection** on images using YOLOv10.
- Show **side-by-side comparison**: Original Image vs. Detection Image.
- Measure inference speed (preprocess/inference/postprocess).
- Organized structure for multi-category datasets.
